# Server-side environment variables for Netlify Functions
# These will be set in Netlify's environment variables dashboard

# Note: Client-side API keys have been removed for security
# API keys are now handled server-side through Netlify Functions

# For local development, you can set these in Netlify CLI:
# netlify env:set GEMINI_API_KEY "your_gemini_api_key_here"
# netlify env:set OPENROUTER_API_KEY "your_openrouter_api_key_here"
